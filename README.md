## This is an implementation of the paper: ***Deep Leraning-driven Proactive Maintenance Management of IoT-empowered Smart Toilet***. 
### In this Repo, we aim at filling the gap of privacy-preserving federated learning framework by providing a federated LSTM Autoencoder model (FedLSTMA) for proactive maintenance of public smart toilet (i.e., public toilet equied with IoT sensors). 
### Thanks to [Pyfhel](https://github.com/ibarrond/Pyfhel), we are able to provide a effective and efficient way to do model updates encryption based on the FHE manner.

## Model Framework
### ***Overall framework (FHE-based)***

### ***Conectivity*** (Connectivity of server and clients based on IP address and port number)
