# FedLSTMA
## This is an implementation of the paper: ***[Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning for Proactive Maintenance of IoT-Empowered Multi-Location Smart City Facilities](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1084804524001735)***. 
### In this Repo, we aim at filling the gap of privacy-preserving federated learning framework by providing a federated LSTM Autoencoder model (FedLSTMA) for proactive maintenance of public smart toilets (i.e., public toilets equipped with IoT sensors). 
### Thanks to [Pyfhel](https://github.com/ibarrond/Pyfhel), we are able to provide an effective and efficient way to do model update encryption based on the FHE manner.

## Framework
