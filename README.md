# FedLSTMA
## This is an official implementation of the paper: ***Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning for Proactive Maintenance of IoT-Empowered Multi-Location Smart City Facilities***. 
### In this Repo, we aim at filling the gap of privacy-preserving federated learning framework by providing a federated LSTM Autoencoder model (FedLSTMA) for proactive maintenance of public smart toilets (i.e., public toilets equipped with IoT sensors). 
### Thanks to [Pyfhel](https://github.com/ibarrond/Pyfhel), we are able to provide an effective and efficient way to do model update encryption based on the FHE manner.

## Framework
### ***Overall framework (FHE-based)***

### ***Experiment*** (Connectivity of server and clients based on IP address and port number)

1. Generate input-like output
2. If the loss is larger than a threshold, then consider the device is in abnormal status.
